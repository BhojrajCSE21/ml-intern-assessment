# AI/ML Intern Assignment

Welcome to the AI/ML Intern assignment! This project is designed to test your core Python skills and your ability to design and build a clean and efficient system from scratch.

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already).
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run Tests (Task 1)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m pytest ml-assignment/tests/test_ngram.py
    ```
4.  **Run Generation Demo (Task 1)**:

    ```bash
    python3 ml-assignment/task2/demo_attention.py
    ```

## Project Structure
-   `ml-assignment/src/ngram_model.py`: Implementation of TrigramModel.
-   `ml-assignment/task2/attention.py`: Implementation of Scaled Dot-Product Attention.
-   `evaluation.md`: Summary of design choices.

## Instructions

1. Any changes to env should be updated in `requirements.txt`.
2. Mention the steps to run your code in `trigram-assignment/README.md`.
3. Feel free to make any changes to the existing code.
4. Please document your design choices in the `evaluation.md` file. This should be a 1-page summary of the decisions you made and why you made them. And all the steps to for us to test.
